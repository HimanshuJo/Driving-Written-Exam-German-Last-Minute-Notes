Speed distance and driving with consideration for the environment

	Outside built-up areas -> flash headlight -> warning signal, announce to overtake

	In built-up areas -> flash headlight -> just as a warning signal

	On narrow roads where oncoming traffic could be endangered you may only drive at a speed that
	allows you to stop within at least 'half of your range of vision'

	At double the speed the reaction distance is 'twice (2)' as long

	At double the speed the braking distance is 'four times (4)' as long

	With snow chains you must not drive any faster than 50 km/h

	Safety Distances:

		One rule of thumb:

			Safety Distance is half of the speed shown on the speedometer

			e.g. If you are driving at 100 km/h the distance between yourself and the vehicle in front of you
				 must be at least 50 meters or more

	-------

	km/hr to m/sec  -> (Speed(km/h)/10) * 3

	Reaction Distance or Reaction Path:

		(Speed(km/h)/10) * 3

	Normal Braking Distance:

		(Speed(km/h)/10) * (Speed(km/h)/10)

	Emergency Braking Distance:

		((Speed(km/h)/10) * (Speed(km/h)/10))/2 => NormalBreakingDistance/2

	Stopping Distance:

		Reaction Path + Normal Breaking Distance

-------

Driving manoeuvres, observing the traffic

	If two vehicles are approaching each other at a speed of 100 km/h, for example
	the come 60 meters closer every second.

	That means 600 meters in 10 seconds

-------

Technical conditions, the transport of passengers and goods

	Increase the tyre pressure by 0.2 bar for long car journeys and if you have winter tyres

	At the rear:

		On stretches of road of 'up to 100km' the load may project by up to 3m

		On stretches of road of 'more than 100km' the load may only project by 1.5m

	As from 1.00m the projecting load must be made identifiable, in the day by

		a bright red sign (30x30cm)

		a bright red flag (30x30cm)

		a cylindrical body (30x35cm)

		in the dark by a red lamp and a red reflector

		The devices for securing the load may be no more than 1.50m above the carriageway
		and the reflectors no more than 90cm above the carriageway

-------

Priority

	Right before left does not apply also apply at:

		at sunken curbstones and

		at the entrance to the carriageway of other parts of the road such as pedestrian paths,
		hard shoulders or parking lanes

-------

Basic rules, road signs and traffic facilities

	square box with distance and arrow signs ahead -> An additional sign to indicate the length of the dangerous stretch of the road

	Triangle with red marking and an exclamation -> When in build-up area, the hazard is expected to be between 150m and 250m

	H2 -> Hydrogen filling station

	CNG -> Natural gas fuel station

	LPG -> Auto gas filling station

-------

Driving manoeuvres, observing the traffic

	How long are the overtaking distances:

		Overtaking distance = (V1/(V1-V2)) * L

		L -> length of V1 + length of V2 + safety distance to V2 + safety distance ahead of V2

	Sign:

		Prohibition on overtaking

			Outer area red, inner area white with two cars, on the left the car is marked red

				Overtaking prohibited for all vehicles. However, motorcycles without a side-car, bicycles with an
				auxiliary motor, trams and non-motorised vehicles may be overtaken

-------

The road traffic system and its use, level crossing

	The halt restriction is valid up to 10m before the sign, if covered by it,
	so that the St. Andrew cross and thus the level crossing may be identified in time

	To improve the visibility of the tracks, parking is prohibited before the St. Andrew's cross
	up to 5m in urban areas and up to 50m in rural areas

	One must wait before the St. Andrew's cross, if

		there is a red flashing light or a yellow or red traffic light - even if the barrier is still open
		(if the red flashing light or the red traffic light is in the form of arrow, only the driver who wishes
		to travel/turn in the direction of the arrow must wait)

	What must you be aware of when joining the motorway

		The through-driving traffic has priority

		One the merging lane, I may drive faster than the through-driving traffic

-------

Other road users

	You may only overtake cyclists in built-up areas with at least 1.5m side clearance

	Outside towns, the distance must be 2m

	When regular buses and school buses are pulling up at a bus stop and have switched
	on their hazard warning lights, they may no longer be overtaken

-------

Technical conditions, the transport of passengers and goods

	Tyre tread

		a new car tyre (with summer tyres) has a depth of approx. 6-8mm

	ASR (Traction Control System)

		prevents the wheels from spinning and 

		reduces the risk of skidding sideways on a slippery road

	-------

	ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)

		the rpm of the individual wheels are measured continuously in vehicles with ABS

		if a wheel locks while braking, the electronics reduces the braking force at the respective
		wheel to the extent that the wheel turns again evenly

		this takes place approx. 50 times per second, i.e much faster than humanly possible

		IMP:

			ABS cannot shorten the braking path, but ensures steerability in case of (emergency) braking

			the vehicle also brakes best possible on a slippery road and you can continue to evade

	-------

	ESP (Electronic Stability Program)

		identifies critical driving states (skidding at the curve, etc.)

		and the vehicle is stabilized, e.g. with electronic braking intervention

	-------

	Cruise Control

		maintaining a constant speed and energy saving driving mode

	-------

	ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control)

		accelerates independently to a 'preset' speed, measures the distance to the preceding vehicle
		and brakes to ensure that safe distance is maintained

	-------

	LDW (Lane Departure Warning System)

		use lane markings to register if the vehicle might leave the lane

		you will be warned, e.g. by a vibrating steering wheel, or the vehicle intervenes in the steering independently

		However, the functionality is limited when there are no road markings or the road is dirty

-------

Stationary Traffic

	Prohibitions against stopping

		at narrow and unclear parts of the roads

		near sharp bends

		on accelerating and deceleration lanes

		on autobahns and clearways

		on zebra crossing and up to 5 meters before them

		on level crossing

		on protection lanes for cyclists

	Parking is not permitted

		anywhere where stopping is prohibited

		up to 5m before and after cross-roads and junctions measured from the intersections
		of the carriageway edges

		up to 8m before and after crossroads and junctions with cycle paths

		before and after diagonal crosses at level crossing
			inside built-up areas up to 5m on each side

			outside built-up areas up to 50m on each side

		on manholes and other covers

	Limited prohibitions on stopping

		Sign: 

			Outer area red, inner area blue with a diagonal marking in red going from top-left to bottom-right

			Drivers not stop for limited prohibition on stopping more than 3 minutes
			on the road, except for boarding or alighting and for loading or unloading.

		Improve the driving skills in the following areas

			Control of the vehicle

			Knowledge of and compliance with the rules

			Perceiving dangers

			Estimation of one's own skills

			Controlling of one's own feelings
